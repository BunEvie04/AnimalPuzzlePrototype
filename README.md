# AnimalPuzzle

Developed with Unreal Engine 5

### Getting Set Up
Upon unzipping the folder containing the project files, the uproject will be available to open to play.
```
AnimalPuzzlr.uproject
```
### How to Play
The game is a really short prototype and can be finished in around a minute or so. 
It starts with an opening menu with full mouse control and displayes the main games controls.
Upon pressing play the game will start playing. 

* WASD to move
* Holding Q brings up the information screen
* E is used to pick up and place the green grass cube

### Key Features
The fox will display different behaviours interchangably, between its free turn and chasing the grass block it views as food.
Currently there are only a few animations that work but this will be changed for the full release
The main information is that the grass block can be used to get the animal to move to a desired location, potentially as a platform if needed(?)

The grass block it the main item seen and will grow again in a different patch once previously consumed, this is still a work in progress however.
